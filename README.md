# Shattered Pixel Dungeon Hack

A Roguelike RPG, with randomly generated levels, items, enemies, and traps! Based on the [source code of Pixel Dungeon](https://github.com/00-Evan/pixel-dungeon-gradle), by [Watabou](https://www.watabou.ru). This mod uses Shattered Pixel Dungeon 0.9.2b as a base and will incorporate ideas from Powered Pixel Dungeon, Re-re Mixed Pixel Dungeon and Moonshine Pixel Dungeon as well as my own ideas. Check pdmod for details on changes to be made.

This is a work in progress not yet in a playable state.

Shattered Pixel Dungeon Hack currently compiles for Android and desktop platforms.
